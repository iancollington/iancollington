### I am Ian Collington. A contract full-stack Java developer with twenty years experience.

You'll find some random repositories here, some of which support my blog posts but I also have two other organisations for two projects; [bootifulmicropizza](https://github.com/bootifulmicropizza) and [serverlesspizza](https://github.com/serverlesspizza).

Activity has slowed somewhat since having a baby daughter in November 2020.
